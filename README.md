# Liri Bot

## About this Project
This is an app to read, interpret and execute several natural language commands from the CLI. The user can specify the main command (`movie-this` or `spotify-this-song`) along with an additional parameter for certain commands.

## Functions
`movieThis`: Query the Open Movie Database (OMDB) API with a movie title and return complete information about the movie.

`spotifyThisSong`: Query the Spotify API with a song title and return the artist, album and a link to a preview MP3.

Technologies used in this app include Node.js, HTTP Request and Spotify API.
